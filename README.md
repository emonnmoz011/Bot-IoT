# Bot-IoT
This project aims to characterize the incoming traffic in an IoT (Internet of Things) environment using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques. We have utilized the Bot-IoT dataset created in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra. There were four categories to characterize in the dataset. The traffic categories are (a) DDoS (b) DoS (c) Reconnaissance and (d) Normal. I implemented (a) SVM (b) LSTM and (c) Vanilla RNN to observe the classification results
For training and testing purpose we have two separate data file. Link for the training and testing data is: https://rb.gy/uyslew.
At first we pre-processed the data which includes dropping unnecessary columns and also converting the strings data to numerical values for each data. During the pre-processing part we did label encoding and also we balanced the train data and test data (not necessary) for further evaluation. 
For the LSTM model we added four Dense layer with no Dropout layer with self defined optimizer. We also used callback so that the training stops after the training accuracy reaches 98%. Same goes with the RNN model, the basic difference is, we just replaced LSTM by SimpleRNN. For the SVM method for faster training purpose, we used linear kernel.
